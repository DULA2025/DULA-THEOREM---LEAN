We define the monoid S and the function `m(n)`.

    This is equivalent to gcd(n, 6) = 1 for n > 0. -/

abbrev Z2 := ZMod 2

### Section 3: The DULA Theorem Statements
-/

/--
The core lemma connecting the congruence class of n modulo 6
to the parity of m(n).
-/
theorem m_parity_iff_mod6 (n : S) : (m n.val) % 2 = 0 ↔ n.val % 6 = 1 := by
  -- The proof would proceed by induction on the prime factorization of n.
  -- It relies on the facts that:
  -- 1. p ≡ 1 (mod 6) => p^k ≡ 1 (mod 6)
  -- 2. p ≡ 5 (mod 6) => p^k ≡ 1 (mod 6) if k is even, and p^k ≡ 5 (mod 6) if k is odd.

Theorem: φ is a monoid homomorphism.
This means φ(a * b) = φ(a) + φ(b).

  map_one' := by
    -- m(1) = 0, and 0 mod 2 = 0.
    simp [phi, m, factorization_one]
  map_mul' := by

    -- This is true because factorization exponents add under multiplication.

Theorem: ψ is a monoid homomorphism.
This means ψ(a * b) = ψ(a) * ψ(b).
-/
theorem psi_is_monoid_hom : MonoidHom S MulZ2 where
  toFun := psi
  map_one' := by
    -- m(1) = 0, so (-1)^0 = 1.
    simp [psi, m, factorization_one]
  map_mul' := by
    -- This uses m(a * b) = m(a) + m(b) and the exponent rule x^(a+b) = x^a * x^b.
    intro a b
    simp [psi, pow_add]
    -- The proof of m(a*b) = m(a) + m(b) is needed here as well.

The isomorphism θ between the codomains of φ and ψ.
It connects the additive structure of Z/2Z to the multiplicative {-1, 1}.

The DULA Theorem: The commutative diagram holds.
This shows that φ and ψ are structurally equivalent via the isomorphism θ.
-/
theorem dula_theorem_commutes (n : S) : psi n = theta (phi n) := by
  -- The proof follows from the definitions and the core lemma.
  -- If m(n) is even, phi(n) = 0, theta(0) = 1, and psi(n) = (-1)^even = 1.
  -- If m(n) is odd, phi(n) = 1, theta(1) = -1, and psi(n) = (-1)^odd = -1.
  unfold psi phi theta
  -- Use the core lemma `m_parity_iff_mod6` to split into cases on m(n) % 2.
